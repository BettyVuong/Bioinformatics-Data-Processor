# About
The program takes a given csv file with data that contains the animals features and class labels. The program can then generate the necessary data with statistics, charts, statistical calculations, and predictions given the appropriate data.
## Applications
### Bar graphs
Displays the class distribution form the csv file to interperet different characteristics.
### Jaccard similarity
Calculation produced for similarity between two animal genome characteristics.
### Hamming distance
Calculation is used for measuring the distance between the DNA sequences. 
### Euclidean distance
Calculation is used to measure the genetic dissimilarity of the DNA sequences.
### Predicting classes and accuracy
Given a sample of a class sequence, the class could be predicted. Using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, the accuracy of the class prediction could be calculated; which is another important component used in bioinformatics.
## To run the program
Use ./vuongBettyA1 as the executable within terminal to run the makefile.
